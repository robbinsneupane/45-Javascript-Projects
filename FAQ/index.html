          What does LOREM mean?

        <div class="answer">
          'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elitâ€¦' (complete
          text) is dummy text that is not meant to mean anything. It is used as
          a placeholder in magazine layouts, for example, in order to give an
          impression of the finished document. The text is intentionally
          unintelligible so that the viewer is not distracted by the content.
          The language is not real Latin and even the first word 'Lorem' does
          not exist. It is said that the lorem ipsum text has been common among
          typesetters since the 16th century. (Source: Wikipedia.com).

        <div class="answer">
          We usually order several different magazines from the same distributor
          in order to save shipping costs (and thus to keep the prices of the
          magazines as low as possible). Unfortunately, there may be delays if a
          single magazine from this order is delivered later.

          Yes, we do! Customers of LOREM (not Ipsum) have come to be living all
          over Europe and even in Japan or Australia. So head over to our shop
          and take a look at our products.

          How can I cancel an active subscription?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You can cancel the subscription at any time in your customer account.
          However, please note that a cancellation period applies. If you wish
          to cancel your subscription, you must let us know at least 30 days
          before the end of the subscription (the expiration date can be found
          on your invoice). Otherwise the subscription will be extended
          automatically. We are unable to refund the remaining amount if you
          cancel your subscription at any point before the end of the
          subscription period.
